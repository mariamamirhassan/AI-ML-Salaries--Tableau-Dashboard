## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to provide a comprehensive analysis of salaries in the fields of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) worldwide. By examining salary data from professionals globally, the project aims to offer insights to individuals interested in entering or already working in these fields. Key questions to be answered include average salaries per country, distribution of salaries based on experience level, common firm sizes and experience levels, employment types, and salary differentials based on experience level and job title.

## Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle, compiled from AI-jobs. It contains salary information from professionals in the AI/ML and Big Data domain for the period 2020-2023. The dataset comprises 3,006 records with 11 variables including work year, experience level, employment type, job title, salary, salary currency, salary in USD, employee residence, remote ratio, company location, and company size.

## Data Pre-processing
Data pre-processing involved omitting redundant columns like "salary" and "salary_currency" as the "salary_in_usd" variable provides a unified criterion for comparison.

## Data Visualization

To address the project objectives, various visualizations were created:
Map chart displaying average salaries in USD per country
Distribution graph illustrating average salary distribution by experience level
Pie chart categorizing firms by size and location
Pie chart categorizing employees by experience level
Pie chart categorizing employment types
Side-by-side circles graph showing average salary by experience level and employment type
Table highlighting average salary by experience level and job title
Results

## The analysis yielded several insights:
Highest average salaries are observed in the United States and Russia.
Salary distribution across experience levels appears to be normally distributed, with mid-level positions exhibiting the largest variation.
Majority of firms (82.3%) fall into the medium-sized category, hiring between 50 to 250 employees annually.
Senior-level positions constitute the majority (66.13%) in the AI/ML field.
Full-time employment is predominant (98.87%) in the sector.
Contract workers, particularly executives, command the highest average salaries, while entry-level part-time workers receive the lowest.
Average salaries vary significantly across job titles and experience levels, with principal data scientists and data analytics leads commanding the highest salaries at executive and senior levels, respectively.
